# Tailwind Class Sorter (VS Code Extension)

A VS Code extension that automatically sorts Tailwind CSS classes using [RustyWind](https://github.com/avencera/rustywind).

[View Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Features

- Automatically sorts Tailwind CSS classes on save
- Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, and HTML files
- Uses RustyWind for reliable and consistent class sorting
- Debug output for troubleshooting
- Test command to check if sorting would occur
- Configurable file and language support

## Tailwind Function Support

The extension can detect and sort Tailwind classes within specified function calls. By default, it supports:

- `cn` (for class-variance-authority + tailwind-merge pattern)
- `cva` (class-variance-authority)
- `clsx`

You can add your own function names through the `tailwindSorter.tailwindFunctions` setting.

Example usage with the `cn` function:

```tsx
className={cn(
  "flex items-center text-nowrap",
  isActive && "font-bold",
  isPending && "pointer-events-none"
)}
```

## Enhanced Class Detection

Version 1.2.0 introduces AST-based class detection for more reliable and comprehensive Tailwind class sorting.
The extension now properly handles:

- Template literals: `` className={`px-4 ${condition ? "pt-2" : "pb-2"}`} ``
- Function calls with multiple arguments: `className={cn("px-4", condition && "pt-2")}`
- Conditional expressions: `className={condition ? "px-4" : "py-2"}`
- Object expressions: `className={cn({ "px-4": isActive })}`
- Tailwind v4 custom property syntax: `border-(--custom-color)`

This provides much more reliable sorting across complex component structures.

## Requirements

ðŸš¨ **RustyWind is required but NOT included in this extension.** This extension uses [RustyWind](https://github.com/avencera/rustywind) to sort Tailwind CSS classes. You must install it separately.

### **Install RustyWind locally (Recommended)**

```sh
yarn add rustywind --dev
```

### **Install RustyWind globally (For older Yarn versions)**

If you are using an older version of Yarn that supports global installs, you can install RustyWind globally:

```sh
yarn add -g rustywind
```
